# neuronovae
Neuronovae is a software package for visualizing the structure of neural activity 
through dynamic, color-coded representations. It integrates calcium imaging data with 
unique colormaps tailored to highlight specific neuronal ensembles, allowing researchers 
to effortlessly explore and interpret complex neural interactions. Whether mapping the 
cortex or visualizing synaptic activity, neuronovae provides a clear, vibrant interface 
for uncovering the hidden dynamics of the brain.
